- Developed a Flask-based web app with RESTful APIs for Semantic Search within a book. Utilized langchain
through Python for unstructured PDF data processing; leveraged Bootstrap and HTML for front-end.
- Utilized OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 APIs within Langchain to create vector embeddings for semantic analysis, performed
similarity searches, and summarized results from top-ranked documents in natural language.
- Implemented Pinecone vector database, enabling vector similarity searches based on cosine similarity.
